# Translation-Dictionary-Builder


This project is to receive the text and extract the non-repeated words with the desired translation and finally enter it into the program.

Registering words in the program can be done in two ways

1 The first way :
In this way, less time will be spent. When the dict_word_anki file is created, import it manually into the program so that the words are entered.

2 The second way:
In this way, which takes some time, we apply to the program and enter all the words one by one, and you must have installed the ankiconnect plugin in the add_ons section of the program.

Important note :
You should not delete the db_just_en.csv file, because this file records all the words that enter the program, and finally, using this database, duplicate words will no longer be recorded.
